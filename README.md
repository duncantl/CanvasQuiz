This is a quick exploration of reading the XML that Canvas generates when exporting a quiz.
I am not very familiar with Canvas quizzes and the range of possible question types and content. 
So this is based on looking at 2 sample quizzes and currently limited to those, with some hopefully
generalizations that apply to others.

The schema is at [http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/ims_qtiasiv1p2p1.xsd](http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/ims_qtiasiv1p2p1.xsd)
The format may be documented [here](http://www.imsglobal.org/question/index.html) but this seems
slightly different.

The exams package might have some data structures to represent questions (or it may just translate directly.)
