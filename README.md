This is a quick exploration of reading the XML that Canvas generates when exporting a quiz.
I am not very familiar with Canvas quizzes and the range of possible question types and content. 
So this is based on looking at 2 sample quizzes and currently limited to those, with some hopefully
generalizations that apply to others.
